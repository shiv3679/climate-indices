# ClimateIndex Library

# ClimateIndex Class

The `ClimateIndex` class provides a systematic and convenient interface for preprocessing climate data and calculating a wide range of climate indices. It can handle different climate variables, including temperature and precipitation, and allows for the selection, resampling, and filling of missing values according to user-defined parameters.

## Temperature-related Indices

For temperature-related analyses, it can calculate indices such as:

- **tx10p**: The percentage of days when daily maximum temperature is below the 10th percentile
- **tx90p**: The percentage of days when daily maximum temperature is above the 90th percentile
- **tn10p**: The percentage of days when daily minimum temperature is below the 10th percentile
- **tn90p**: The percentage of days when daily minimum temperature is above the 90th percentile
- **frost_days**: Number of frost days (when daily minimum temperature is below 0°C)
- **warm_spell_duration_index**: The maximum length of a run of days with daily maximum temperature above the 90th percentile
- **cold_spell_duration_index**: The maximum length of a run of days with daily minimum temperature below the 10th percentile.
- **Diurnal Temperature Range (DTR)**: The mean monthly diurnal temperature range.
- **Summer Days (SU)**: The annual count of days when daily maximum temperature is above 25°C.
- **Icing Days (ID)**: The annual count of days when daily maximum temperature is below 0°C.
- **Tropical Nights (TR)**: The annual count of days when daily minimum temperature is above 20°C.
- **Growing Season Length (GSL)**: The length of the growing season in day

## Precipitation-related Indices

For precipitation-related analyses, it can calculate indices such as:

- **percentile_p**: The sum of precipitation in wet days exceeding a given percentile during a time period
- **precip_days**: The number of days with precipitation exceeding a specified threshold
- **rxnday**: The highest n-day total precipitation amount for a given resampling frequency
- **Consecutive Dry Days (CDD)**: The maximum length of dry spell in days.
- **Consecutive Wet Days (CWD)**: The maximum length of wet spell in days.
- **Simple Precipitation Intensity Index (SDII)**: The annual mean precipitation intensity on wet days.

## Testing

The class also includes a testing method to ensure all calculations are performed correctly. The modularity of the class allows for easy expansion to include additional climate indices in the future.


## Installation

### From PyPI (when available)

You can install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install climate_library
```

### From GitHub

Alternatively, you can install the library directly from the GitHub repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/shiv3679/climate-indices.git
```

### Dependencies

The following packages are required dependencies and will be installed automatically:

- xarray
- xclim
- numpy

### Compatibility

The library is compatible with Python 3.6 and higher.


## Usage

### Initialization

Create an instance of the `ClimateIndex` class by providing the path to your climate data file. This class is the main entry point for working with climate indices in this library.

#### Example

```python
from climate_library.climate_index import ClimateIndex

# Path to the NetCDF file containing climate data
datafile = 'path/to/your/datafile.nc'

# Create an instance of the ClimateIndex class
climate_index = ClimateIndex(datafile)
```

The `datafile` parameter should be the path to a NetCDF file that contains the climate data you want to analyze. The file must include dimensions for time, latitude, and longitude, and it must contain the relevant climate variables (e.g., temperature, precipitation) that you wish to use in calculating climate indices.

Once you have created an instance of the `ClimateIndex` class, you can use its methods to preprocess the data and calculate various climate indices, as described in the following sections.


## Preprocessing Method

``` {.python language="Python"}
climate_index.pre_process(time_range=None, fill_missing=None, resample_freq=None, months=None, season=None, resample_method='mean')
```

-   `time_range` (tuple, optional): This parameter allows you to specify a start and end time for the data you want to analyze. By providing a tuple with two date strings, you can subset the dataset to include only the observations within that time frame.
    -   Example: `time_range=('1961-01-01', '1990-12-31')` will include only the data from January 1, 1961, to December 31, 1990.
    -   Use Case: This can be useful when analyzing climate patterns over specific periods or when comparing different decades.

-   `fill_missing` (int, float, or 'interpolate', optional): This parameter provides options to handle missing values (NaN) in the dataset.
    - If a numerical value is provided, all missing values will be replaced with that number.
    - If `interpolate` is specified, linear interpolation will be used to estimate missing values based on neighbouring observations.
    - Example: `fill_missing=0` will replace all NaN values with 0.
    - Use Case: Handling missing values is crucial in climate analysis to avoid bias and errors in subsequent calculations.

-   `resample_freq` (str, optional): This parameter defines the frequency at which the data should be resampled. It allows you to change the time-frequency of the dataset.
    - Example: `resample_freq='MS'` will resample the data to monthly frequency, starting at the beginning of each month.
    - Use Case: Resampling is useful when analysing data at a different temporal resolution, such as monthly or yearly.

-   `months` (list, optional): This parameter allows you to select specific months from the dataset.
    - Example: `months=[1, 2, 3]` will include only the data from January, February, and March.
    - Use Case: Useful for seasonal analysis or when studying climate behaviour during particular months.

-   `season` (str, optional): This parameter enables the selection of data for a specific meteorological season.
    - Example: season='JJA' will include only the data from the summer months (June, July, August).
    - Use Case: Helpful for analyzing seasonal patterns and variations in climate.

-   `resample_method` (str, optional, default='mean'): This parameter defines the method used for resampling when changing the time-frequency with `resample_freq`.
    - Default is `mean`, meaning that the mean value of the observations within each resampling period will be used.
    - Other methods, such as `sum`, `max`, etc., can be specified if needed.
    - Use Case: This provides flexibility in how the data is aggregated when resampling, allowing for different types of analysis and interpretation.

#### Additional Checks 
- **Units Check**: The function also performs a check on the unit of the data variables. It supports 'K' for temperature and 'm' for precipitation.
- **Special Rule**: If season is 'DJF', and `resample_freq` is not specified, it defaults to 'QS-DEC'.

#### Example Usage

```python
climate_index.pre_process(time_range=('2000-01-01', '2020-12-31'), resample_freq='M', fill_missing='interpolate')
```

This example demonstrates how to preprocess the data by selecting a time range, resampling to monthly frequency, and interpolating missing values. Adjust these parameters according to your specific needs and analysis goals.
